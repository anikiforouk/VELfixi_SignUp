                <h1>Terms of Service</h1><br>

                <h1>Introduction</h1><br>

                <p>Welcome to VELfixi, where we strive to help homeowners and home buyers by bringing them together on
                    one platform. By using our website, tools, and services, you agree to comply with and be bound by
                    the following terms and conditions. Please review these terms carefully and periodically. If you do
                    not agree with these terms, you should not use our services. If you have a suggestion or find any
                    issues, feel free to contact us and we will do our best to assist.</p><br>

                <h1>Use of Services</h1><br>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Eligibility:</b> You must be at least 18 years old to use our services.</li>
                    <li><b>Account Registration:</b> You may need to create an account to access certain features. You
                        are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for all
                        activities that occur under your account. Do not post anything that you do not want to be made
                        publicly available. For example, if you post a photo of your property that has personal photos
                        in the background, then you are accepting the responsibility for such information.</li>
                    <li><b>Acceptable Use:</b> You agree to use VELfixi services only for lawful purposes and in
                        accordance with these Terms of Service. You will not use our services for any fraudulent or
                        malicious activity. If VELfixi finds fraud, we will report it to the relevant authorities and
                        may hold the malicious user liable for damage caused to VELfixi and its users. For example, if
                        you are not the actual owner and try to or successfully post that property as though you owned
                        it, we may impose fines on that. If you are a realtor and post a property, please make sure that
                        you have a signed Listing Agreement in hand.</li>
                    <li><b>Prohibited Activities:</b> You agree not to engage in any of the following activities:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Violating any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
                            <li>Posting false, inaccurate, or misleading information.</li>
                            <li>Infringing on any third party's rights, including intellectual property rights.</li>
                            <li>Engaging in any activity that disrupts or interferes with our services.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol><br>
